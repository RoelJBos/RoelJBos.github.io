Welcome! I am a Postdoc in the [Department of International Economics, Governance, and Business (EGB)](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business/) at Copenhagen Business School. 

I study political institutions and political economy, with a focus on the role of interest groups in policymaking. In my research, I primarily develop applied formal models to study how political and institutional frictions affect strategic incentives of policymaking actors, including interest groups, parties, and legislators.

I defended my PhD in Politics at Princeton University in August 2025. Additionally, I hold an MA Politics from Princeton, an MSc Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a BA Liberal Arts and Sciences (Economics and Political Science) from University College Utrecht at Utrecht University. 

Prior to graduate school, I was a Policy Economist (trainee) in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy of the Netherlands.
