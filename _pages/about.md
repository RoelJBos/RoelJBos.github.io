Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Politics at Princeton University, and a fellow in the Quantitative and Analytical Political Science (QAPS) program. 

My research focuses on the diverse role(s) of interest groups in policymaking, primarily using formal theory methods. 

I hold an MA Politics from Princeton, an MSc Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a BA Liberal Arts and Sciences (Economics and Political Science) from University College Utrecht, Utrecht University. 

Prior to graduate school, I was a Policy Economist (trainee) in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy of the Netherlands.
